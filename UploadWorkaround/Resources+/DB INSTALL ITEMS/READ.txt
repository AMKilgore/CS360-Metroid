Set-up instructions for the MySQL database.

Download XAMPP if not already downloaded - remember where it saves to.
Go into the folder it saved in and find the sub-folder titled 'htdocs'. 
Drop the Metroid folder containing .php files in there.
Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL.
Go to localhost in a web browser, and at the top of the page click phpMyAdmin.
A bar across the top of the screen should have an Import tab, go there.
Choose the metroiddb.sql file and 'Go'.

This set-up should function correctly without need to edit code in C# per device.
Please let me know if the situation turns out otherwise.

The database is:
Titled 'metroiddb'
With a table titled 'userinfo'
Containing two columns of 'username' and 'password', and 5 TestUser accounts.

The saving method is:
Encapsulated in the script related to the database 
and connected to the PlayerMovement script's variables.
And currently still being implemented.
